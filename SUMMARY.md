**GTSDB: The German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 900 images with 852 labeled objects belonging to 43 different classes including *keep right*, *priority road*, *speed limit 50*, and other: *speed limit 30*, *give way*, *no overtaking (trucks)*, *speed limit 120*, *no overtaking*, *priority at next intersection*, *speed limit 80*, *speed limit 70*, *speed limit 100*, *danger*, *construction*, *speed limit 60*, *stop*, *no entry*, *go straight*, *go right*, *slippery road*, *restriction ends 80*, *traffic signal*, *snow*, *go left*, *no traffic both ways*, *school crossing*, *go right or straight*, *uneven road*, *roundabout*, *bend right*, *no trucks*, *bend*, *restriction ends (overtaking)*, *restriction ends (overtaking (trucks))*, *speed limit 20*, *cycles crossing*, *pedestrian crossing*, *keep left*, *bend left*, *road narrows*, *restriction ends*, *animals*, and *go left or straight*.

Images in the GTSDB dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 394 (44% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (600 images) and *test* (300 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 4 traffic sign categories: ***prohibitory*** (396 objects), ***other*** (186 objects), ***danger*** (156 objects), and ***mandatory*** (114 objects). Explore them in the supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2013 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">University of Bochum, Germany</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">University of Copenhagen, Denmark</span>.
